      <h2 class="heading1">What is a Virtual Lab?</h2>
      <p class="para">
        A virtual lab is a digital or online environment that simulates
        real-world laboratory experiments or experiences. It allows users to
        conduct experiments, practice skills, or explore scientific concepts
        using computer software, often without the need for physical equipment
        or physical presence in a traditional laboratory setting. Virtual labs
        are commonly used in education, research, and industry for their
        accessibility, and ability to enhance learning and experimentation.

      <h2 class="heading2">Virtual Lab Data Structures And Algorithm</h2>
      <p class="para">
        A virtual lab for data structures and algorithms is an online platform
        that provides interactive tools and resources for learning and
        practicing fundamental concepts in computer science. It typically offers
        virtual simulations, coding exercises, and visualizations to help
        students and professionals develop problem-solving skills and understand
        how data structures and algorithms work. These virtual labs are valuable
        for self-paced learning and skill development in the field of computer
        science and programming.

      <h2 class="heading1">Salient Features</h2>
      <p class="para">
        A Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) lab typically features
        interactive coding exercises, algorithm simulations, and visualization
        tools. It offers hands-on experience in implementing and analyzing data
        structures and algorithms, fostering problem-solving skills. Students
        can practice, experiment, and gain a deep understanding of DSA concepts,
        enhancing their computer science education.
